Let‚Äôs walk through **what happens step-by-step when you run a DML statement (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)** in MySQL using the **InnoDB storage engine**.

I'll keep it simple and beginner-friendly, with a real-world style example and clear flow.

---

## üë§ Scenario:
You run this on your app or terminal:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 80000 WHERE id = 101;
```

---

## üí° Goal: Understand what happens **internally** ‚Äî from connection to disk write.

---

## üîÑ Full Step-by-Step: What happens during a DML in MySQL (with InnoDB)

---

### üîå 1. **Client Connects**
- User (or app) connects to MySQL using:
  ```bash
  mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1
  ```
- A session starts, connection is created.

---

### üó£Ô∏è 2. **User Sends SQL**
- You run:
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE employees SET salary = 80000 WHERE id = 101;
  ```

---

### üß† 3. **MySQL Parser & Optimizer**
- MySQL parses the SQL.
- Checks if the query is valid.
- Uses optimizer to decide **best index or full scan**.

---

### üîí 4. **InnoDB Locks the Row**
- InnoDB finds the row with `id = 101`.
- Applies a **row-level lock** so no one else can change it until this transaction finishes.

---

### üîô 5. **Undo Log Written**
- Before changing the row, InnoDB **writes the old version** (say salary = 60000) into **Undo Log**.
- This allows:
  - Rollback if needed
  - Other transactions to still read old value (MVCC)

---

### üîÑ 6. **Change in Buffer Pool (Memory)**
- The row in memory (Buffer Pool) is **updated to 80000**.
- The change is **NOT yet written to disk**.

---

### üîÅ 7. **Redo Log Written**
- A record of the change is written to the **Redo Log** (on disk):
  > "Row id=101, column=salary changed to 80000"

- This ensures that if MySQL crashes now, **redo log can recover**.

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **COMMIT**
You run:
```sql
COMMIT;
```

- MySQL **flushes the redo log** (depending on `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`).
- The transaction is now **durable** (will survive crash).
- **Row lock is released.**

---

### üíæ 9. **Dirty Page Flushed Later**
- The actual updated page (with salary=80000) in memory is called a **dirty page**.
- It is written to **datafile** (`ibd` file) **later** by a background process.

### üßæ Summary in Plain English

| Step | What Happens                                |
|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1    | You connect to MySQL                        |
| 2    | You send SQL (e.g., UPDATE)                 |
| 3    | MySQL parses and plans the query            |
| 4    | InnoDB locks the row                        |
| 5    | InnoDB writes old value to Undo Log         |
| 6    | Updates value in memory (Buffer Pool)       |
| 7    | Writes redo log to ensure durability        |
| 8    | On COMMIT, redo log is flushed              |
| 9    | Actual row is written to disk later         |

### ‚úÖ Files Involved

| File/Area         | Role                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Buffer Pool       | In-memory data cache              |
| Undo Log          | For rollback, MVCC                |
| Redo Log          | For crash recovery                |
| `.ibd` Data File  | Final data file on disk           |

## üÜï Example 1: INSERT Flow

### üéØ Query:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (102, 'Asha', 70000);
```

---

### üîÑ Step-by-Step Flow

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. **Client Connects** | You connect to MySQL (via CLI/app). |
| 2. **SQL Sent** | MySQL receives the `INSERT` query. |
| 3. **Parse & Optimize** | MySQL validates query, prepares execution plan. |
| 4. **Lock Table/Gap (if needed)** | InnoDB checks for uniqueness (primary key/id = 102), may use gap lock to avoid duplicate inserts. |
| 5. **Undo Log Created** | No old version exists, but undo log records the **insert action** so it can be undone if rollback. |
| 6. **Row Inserted in Buffer Pool** | The new row is added to memory (InnoDB Buffer Pool). |
| 7. **Redo Log Written** | Insert is logged into the Redo Log (insert id=102, values...). |
| 8. **COMMIT** | Redo log is flushed to disk ‚Üí data is now durable. |
| 9. **Datafile Write (Later)** | The new row is flushed to `.ibd` datafile in background. |

---

## ‚ùå Example 2: DELETE Flow

### üéØ Query:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 101;
```

---

### üîÑ Step-by-Step Flow

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. **Client Connects** | MySQL session starts. |
| 2. **SQL Sent** | You send the `DELETE` query. |
| 3. **Parse & Optimize** | MySQL parses the SQL, uses index to find `id = 101`. |
| 4. **Row Lock** | InnoDB locks the row with `id = 101`. |
| 5. **Undo Log Created** | Old row data is copied into Undo Log to allow rollback. |
| 6. **Mark Row as Deleted in Buffer Pool** | The row is marked as deleted in memory (not removed instantly). |
| 7. **Redo Log Written** | A delete record is written to the redo log. |
| 8. **COMMIT** | Redo log flushed ‚Üí delete is confirmed. |
| 9. **Purge Later** | Background thread later **removes the row** from disk. |

## üß† Bonus Summary Table (All 3 Together)

| Action   | Undo Log | Redo Log | Buffer Pool | Datafile Write | Lock |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|----------------|------|
| `INSERT` | Yes (for rollback) | Yes | New row added | Row written later | May use gap lock |
| `UPDATE` | Yes (old version) | Yes | Row changed | Page flushed later | Row lock |
| `DELETE` | Yes (old row) | Yes | Row marked deleted | Purged later | Row lock |
