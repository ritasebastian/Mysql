Let’s break down **`gh-ost` vs `pt-online-schema-change`** in the context of **Cloud SQL for MySQL** (GCP managed service), focusing on **compatibility, reliability, and production-readiness**.

## 🧠 What Are These Tools?

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **gh-ost** | GitHub’s tool for non-blocking schema changes using binlog |
| **pt-online-schema-change (pt-osc)** | Percona’s tool using triggers and table copy |

## 🔍 Feature-by-Feature Comparison for Cloud SQL for MySQL

| Feature                              | **gh-ost**                              | **pt-online-schema-change**             |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🔌 Cloud SQL Compatibility           | ✅ Partial (with setup)                  | ⚠️ Very Limited (not supported by default) |
| 🧱 Uses triggers                     | ❌ No                                     | ✅ Yes                                    |
| 🧠 Binlog-based (replica-safe)       | ✅ Yes (reads binlog directly)           | ❌ No (relies on triggers)               |
| 🚫 Requires SUPER privilege          | ❌ No (works without `SUPER`)            | ⚠️ Often requires `SUPER` for safety     |
| 📜 Works with GTID-based replication | ✅ Yes                                   | ⚠️ Requires `--set-vars` + care          |
| 📥 Binary logging required           | ✅ Yes (`--assume-rbr` required)         | ✅ Yes                                    |
| 🌀 Replication lag handling          | ✅ Advanced (auto throttle)              | ⚠️ Basic                                 |
| 🧪 Dry-run support                   | ✅ Yes                                   | ⚠️ No native dry-run                     |
| 🛡️ Safer in managed environments     | ✅ More predictable (less intrusive)     | ❌ Triggers can break with Cloud SQL’s restrictions |
| 🛠️ Installation                     | Binary (static)                         | Requires Percona Toolkit install         |
| 🧾 Logging and progress tracking     | ✅ Built-in JSON logs + verbosity        | ⚠️ Limited CLI output                    |

## ✅ Cloud SQL Compatibility Summary

| Tool      | Can You Use in Cloud SQL? | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------|
| **gh-ost** | ✅ Yes, with `binlog` and `--allow-on-master` | Ideal for Cloud SQL when run externally |
| **pt-osc** | ❌ Not officially supported by Cloud SQL | Requires root-like permissions + triggers not always allowed |

> 🔐 Cloud SQL **disables some low-level privileges** like `SUPER`, `FILE`, etc., which pt-osc often needs.

---

## 🚧 Why `pt-osc` Often Fails in Cloud SQL

- Uses **3 triggers (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)** on the original table
- Triggers can:
  - Conflict with existing triggers
  - Get blocked by Cloud SQL permissions
- Cannot guarantee behavior under high write load without `SUPER`

---

## ✅ Why `gh-ost` Works Better on Cloud SQL

- **No triggers** involved  
- Uses **binlog stream** to replicate live changes  
- Can be run **outside the DB** using Cloud SQL Proxy  
- More resilient to **failover, GTID, and read replicas**

---

## ⚖️ Final Verdict: Use `gh-ost` on Cloud SQL

| Feature               | **Recommended Tool**     |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Cloud SQL support     | ✅ `gh-ost`              |
| Schema change safety  | ✅ `gh-ost`              |
| GTID/replication safe | ✅ `gh-ost`              |
| Low privilege usage   | ✅ `gh-ost`              |
| On-prem MySQL         | `pt-osc` may still be viable |

---

## 🧪 Real-World Recommendation

- For **GCP Cloud SQL**, always use:
  ```bash
  gh-ost --assume-rbr --allow-on-master --execute
  ```
- For **Percona MySQL** on EC2 or GKE (with full root), `pt-osc` is still great.
