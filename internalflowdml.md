Let's go step-by-step and break down the **full internal flow in MySQL** (with InnoDB engine) when a **DML statement (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)** is executed — focusing on how:

- ✅ **Undo log**
- ✅ **Redo log**
- ✅ **Binary log (binlog)**
- ✅ **Disk write (datafile)**

are used and in what **order**.

## 💡 Real DML Example:
```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 80000 WHERE id = 101;
```

## 🔄 Internal Flow in MySQL (InnoDB)

Here’s the step-by-step lifecycle of that DML:

### 🔁 Step-by-Step Breakdown

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Transaction starts** | Implicit or explicit `BEGIN` |
| 2️⃣ | **Undo log written** | Old data (e.g., salary = 60000) is written to **Undo Log** → allows **ROLLBACK** and MVCC |
| 3️⃣ | **Buffer pool updated** | New data (salary = 80000) written to InnoDB **Buffer Pool (memory)** |
| 4️⃣ | **Redo log written** | A **Redo Log** record is generated for crash recovery (what was changed, where) |
| 5️⃣ | **Binlog prepared** (if binlog is ON) | A logical event (like `UPDATE employees...`) is written to the **Binary Log cache**, not yet flushed |
| 6️⃣ | **COMMIT issued** | You run `COMMIT;` |
| 7️⃣ | **Redo log flushed to disk** | InnoDB writes the redo log to disk (depending on `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`) |
| 8️⃣ | **Binlog flushed to disk** | MySQL server writes binlog from cache to disk, then calls **fsync()** |
| 9️⃣ | **Transaction marked as committed** | Safe to return success to client |
| 🔟 | **Datafile updated (later)** | Dirty page in buffer pool eventually written to `.ibd` file by background **flush thread** |

---

### 🔐 Atomicity/Durability Ensured

MySQL ensures that:
- **Redo log** (InnoDB crash recovery) and
- **Binlog** (replication + PITR)

are both safely on disk **before committing** — this is called the **2-phase commit (2PC)** between InnoDB and binlog.

## 🔁 Visual Timeline Flow

```
[BEGIN]
   │
[Undo Log]   ← stores old version
   │
[Buffer Pool Updated]
   │
[Redo Log Written]
   │
[Binary Log Event Created]
   │
[COMMIT]
   ├── Redo Log fsync
   ├── Binlog fsync
   └── Mark transaction as committed
   │
[Client gets OK]
   │
[Data written to .ibd file later by flush thread]
```

## 📂 File Types Involved

| File/Log         | Purpose                             | File Type |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Undo log**      | Rollback & MVCC                     | undo_001, undo_002 |
| **Redo log**      | Crash recovery                      | `ib_logfile0`, `ib_logfile1` |
| **Binlog**        | Replication + PITR                  | `mysql-bin.000001`, etc. |
| **Datafile**      | Final row storage (.ibd)            | `employees.ibd` |

## 📌 Important Settings

| Variable                        | Role                            |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` | Controls **redo log flush**     |
| `sync_binlog`                   | Controls **binlog flush**       |
| `autocommit`                    | If ON, every DML = auto-commit  |
