You **can upgrade Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.7 to 8.0** — but you need to plan carefully because:

> ⚠️ **It’s a one-way, irreversible upgrade**  
> ⚠️ It requires a **restart**, causing downtime  
> ⚠️ Incompatible schema or queries may **break your app** if not tested

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Guide to Upgrade Cloud SQL from MySQL 5.7 → 8.0

---

### 🪜 Step 1: **Check Current Version**

You can check via Console or CLI:
```sql
SELECT VERSION();
```

Or:
```bash
gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME --format="value(databaseVersion)"
```

---

### 🪜 Step 2: **Create a Pre-Upgrade Clone (Highly Recommended)**

Clone your current instance to test upgrade:
```bash
gcloud sql instances clone INSTANCE_NAME INSTANCE_NAME-clone
```

This creates a copy (with 5.7) you can safely upgrade and test.

---

### 🪜 Step 3: **Test Compatibility with MySQL 8.0**

Cloud SQL gives you a built-in checker:

```bash
gcloud sql instances check-upgrade INSTANCE_NAME
```

✅ This will show:
- Unsupported character sets
- Deprecated functions
- Compatibility warnings

Fix any issues shown before proceeding.

---

### 🪜 Step 4: **Review Application Compatibility**

Things that may break:
| Feature/Query | MySQL 8.0 Change |
|---------------|------------------|
| `utf8`        | Now maps to `utf8mb3` instead of `utf8mb4` |
| `ZEROFILL`, `DISPLAY WIDTH` | Deprecated |
| Old-style joins | May break in strict SQL mode |
| Reserved keywords | Some new ones added in 8.0 (e.g., `RANK`, `WINDOW`) |

> 🧪 Test your app with the **cloned instance upgraded to 8.0** before doing it on prod.

---

### 🪜 Step 5: **Schedule Downtime (Upgrade Requires Restart)**

Let users and teams know. Set a **maintenance window** if needed.

---

### 🪜 Step 6: **Perform the Upgrade**

```bash
gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME \
  --database-version=MYSQL_8_0
```

Or via Cloud Console:
- Go to Cloud SQL → Instance → Edit
- Under **Database Version**, choose **MySQL 8.0**
- Click **Save**

This will:
- Stop the instance
- Upgrade it to 8.0
- Restart it

⚠️ Expect **a few minutes of downtime**

---

### 🪜 Step 7: **Verify Upgrade**

After restart:
```sql
SELECT VERSION();
```

Also:
- Run health checks
- Confirm application connectivity
- Check query performance
- Monitor error logs in Cloud Logging

---

### 🪜 Step 8: **Clean Up (Optional)**

Once everything is tested and working:
- Delete the cloned instance (if not needed)
```bash
gcloud sql instances delete INSTANCE_NAME-clone
```

---

## ✅ Summary of Commands

```bash
# Check current version
gcloud sql instances describe my-instance

# Clone instance
gcloud sql instances clone my-instance my-instance-clone

# Check upgrade compatibility
gcloud sql instances check-upgrade my-instance-clone

# Upgrade the clone
gcloud sql instances patch my-instance-clone --database-version=MYSQL_8_0

# Upgrade the actual instance (after testing)
gcloud sql instances patch my-instance --database-version=MYSQL_8_0
```

## 🧯 Tips

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| Test in staging first | Avoid breaking production |
| Backup before upgrade | Just in case! |
| Use `Query Insights` post-upgrade | Catch performance regressions |
| Review `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views | Some structure changes in 8.0 |
